#sc policy

The following operations can be performed on "sc policy":


[add](#add-sc-policy) | [rm](#rm-sc-policy) | [set](#set-sc-policy) | [unset](#unset-sc-policy) | [show](#show-sc-policy) | [stat](#stat-sc-policy)

##add sc policy

Creates a new SureConnect policy.


##Synopsys

add sc policy &lt;name> [-url &lt;URL> | -rule &lt;expression>] [-delay &lt;usecs>] [-maxConn &lt;positive_integer>] [-action &lt;action>  (&lt;altContentSvcName>  &lt;altContentPath>)]


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name for the policy. Must begin with an ASCII alphabetic or underscore (_) character, and must contain only ASCII alphanumeric, underscore, hash (#), period (.), space, colon (:), at (@), equals (=), and hyphen (-) characters.

<b>url</b>
URL against which to match incoming client request.

<b>rule</b>
Expression against which the traffic is evaluated. 
Maximum length of a string literal in the expression is 255 characters. A longer string can be split into smaller strings of up to 255 characters each, and the smaller strings concatenated with the + operator. For example, you can create a 500-character string as follows: '"&lt;string of 255 characters&gt;" + "&lt;string of 245 characters&gt;"'
The following requirements apply only to the NetScaler CLI:
* If the expression includes one or more spaces, enclose the entire expression in double quotation marks.
* If the expression itself includes double quotation marks, escape the quotations by using the  character. 
* Alternatively, you can use single quotation marks to enclose the rule, in which case you do not have to escape the double quotation marks.

<b>delay</b>
Delay threshold, in microseconds, for requests that match the policy's URL or rule. If the delay statistics gathered for the matching request exceed the specified delay, SureConnect is triggered for that request.
Minimum value: 1
Maximum value: 599999999

<b>maxConn</b>
Maximum number of concurrent connections that can be open for requests that match the policy's URL or rule.
Minimum value: 1
Maximum value: 4294967294

<b>action</b>
Action to be taken when the delay or maximum-connections threshold is reached. Available settings function as follows:
ACS - Serve content from an alternative content service.
NS - Serve alternative content from the NetScaler appliance.
NO ACTION - Serve no alternative content. However, delay statistics are still collected for the configured URLs, and, if the Maximum Client Connections parameter is set, the number of connections is limited to the value specified by that parameter. (However, alternative content is not served even if the maxConn threshold is met).
Possible values: ACS, NS, NOACTION

<b>altContentSvcName</b>
Name of the alternative content service to be used in the ACS action.

<b>altContentPath</b>
Path to the alternative content service to be used in the ACS action.

##Arguments

##Outputs

<b>url</b>
The URL name. The  system matches the incoming client request against the URL you enter here.

<b>rule</b>
The rule that the system matches with the incoming request.
The system matches the incoming request against the rules you enter here. Before matching against the configured rules, the NetScaler 9000 system matches the requests with any of the configured URLs. Thus, URLs have a higher precedence over rules. If the incoming request does not match any of the configured URLs or the rules that have been configured, then SureConnect does not trigger.
Expression logic is expression names, separated by the logical operators || and && , and possibly grouped using parenthesis. If the expression contains blanks (for example, between an expression name and a logical operator), then the entire argument must be enclosed in double quotes.The following are valid expression logic:
ns_ext_cgi||ns_ext_asp
ns_non_get && (ns_header_cookie||ns_header_pragma)

<b>delay</b>
Delay threshold, in microseconds, for requests that match the policy's URL or rule. If the delay statistics gathered for the matching request exceed the specified delay, SureConnect is triggered for that request.

<b>maxConn</b>
Maximum number of concurrent connections that can be open for requests that match the policy's URL or rule.

<b>action</b>
The action to be taken when the thresholds are met. The valid options are ACS , NS and NOACTION .
  ACS - Specifies that alternate content is to be served from altContSvcName with the path altContPath .
  NS - Specifies that alternate content is to be served from the NetScaler 9000 system. See the set sc parameter command to customize the response served from the system.
  NOACTION - Specifies that no alternate content is to be served. However, delay statistics are still collected for the configured URLs. If the - maxconn argument is specified, the number of connections is limited to that specified value for that configured URL or rule (alternate content will not served even if the - maxconn threshold is met).

<b>altContentSvcName</b>
Name of the alternative content service to be used in the ACS action.

<b>altContentPath</b>
Path to the alternative content service to be used in the ACS action.
