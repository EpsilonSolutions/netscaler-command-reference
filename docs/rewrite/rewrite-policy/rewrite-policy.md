#rewrite policy

The following operations can be performed on "rewrite policy":


[add](#add-rewrite-policy) | [rm](#rm-rewrite-policy) | [set](#set-rewrite-policy) | [unset](#unset-rewrite-policy) | [show](#show-rewrite-policy) | [stat](#stat-rewrite-policy) | [rename](#rename-rewrite-policy)

##add rewrite policy

Creates a rewrite policy, which specifies which requests or responses to rewrite.


##Synopsys

add rewrite policy &lt;name> &lt;rule> &lt;action> [&lt;undefAction>] [-comment &lt;string>] [-logAction &lt;string>]


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name for the rewrite policy. Must begin with a letter, number, or the underscore character (_), and must contain only letters, numbers, and the hyphen (-), period (.) hash (#), space ( ), at (@), equals (=), colon (:), and underscore characters. Can be changed after the rewrite policy is added.
The following requirement applies only to the NetScaler CLI:
If the name includes one or more spaces, enclose the name in double or single quotation marks (for example, "my rewrite policy" or 'my rewrite policy').

<b>rule</b>
Expression against which traffic is evaluated. Written in default syntax.
Note:
Maximum length of a string literal in the expression is 255 characters. A longer string can be split into smaller strings of up to 255 characters each, and the smaller strings concatenated with the + operator. For example, you can create a 500-character string as follows: '"&lt;string of 255 characters&gt;" + "&lt;string of 245 characters&gt;"'
(Classic expressions are not supported in the cluster build.)
The following requirements apply only to the NetScaler CLI:
* If the expression includes one or more spaces, enclose the entire expression in double quotation marks.
* If the expression itself includes double quotation marks, escape the quotations by using the \\ character. 
* Alternatively, you can use single quotation marks to enclose the rule, in which case you do not have to escape the double quotation marks.

<b>action</b>
Name of the rewrite action to perform if the request or response matches this rewrite policy.
There are also some built-in actions which can be used. These are:
* NOREWRITE - Send the request from the client to the server or response from the server to the client without making any changes in the message.
* RESET - Resets the client connection by closing it. The client program, such as a browser, will handle this and may inform the user. The client may then resend the request if desired.
* DROP - Drop the request without sending a response to the user.

<b>undefAction</b>
Action to perform if the result of policy evaluation is undefined (UNDEF). An UNDEF event indicates an internal error condition. Only the above built-in actions can be used.

<b>comment</b>
Any comments to preserve information about this rewrite policy.

<b>logAction</b>
Name of messagelog action to use when a request matches this policy.
