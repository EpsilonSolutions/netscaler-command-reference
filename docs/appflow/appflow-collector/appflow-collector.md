#appflow collector

The following operations can be performed on "appflow collector":


[add](#add-appflow-collector) | [set](#set-appflow-collector) | [unset](#unset-appflow-collector) | [rm](#rm-appflow-collector) | [rename](#rename-appflow-collector) | [show](#show-appflow-collector)

##add appflow collector

Adds a new AppFlow collector. A collector receives the flow records generated by the NetScaler appliance.You can add only four AppFlow collectors to the NetScaler appliance.


##Synopsys

add appflow collector &lt;name> -IPAddress &lt;ip_addr> [-port &lt;port>] [-netProfile &lt;string>] [-Transport ( ipfix | logstream )]


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name for the collector. Must begin with an ASCII alphabetic or underscore (_) character, and must contain only ASCII alphanumeric, underscore, hash (#), period (.), space, colon (:), at
(@), equals (=), and hyphen (-) characters.
 Only four collectors can be configured. 
The following requirement applies only to the NetScaler CLI:
If the name includes one or more spaces, enclose the name in double or single quotation marks (for example, "my appflow collector" or 'my appflow collector').

<b>IPAddress</b>
IPv4 address of the collector.

<b>port</b>
Port on which the collector listens.

<b>netProfile</b>
Netprofile to associate with the collector. The IP address defined in the profile is used as the source IP address for AppFlow traffic for this collector.  If you do not set this parameter, the NetScaler IP (NSIP) address is used as the source IP address.

<b>Transport</b>
Type of collector: either logstream or ipfix.
Possible values: ipfix, logstream
Default value: ipfix,



##Example

add appflow collector collector1 -IPAddress 192.168.1.40 -port 2055

##set appflow collector

Sets an AppFlow collector. A collector receives the flow records generated by the NetScaler appliance.


##Synopsys

set appflow collector &lt;name> [-IPAddress &lt;ip_addr>] [-port &lt;port>] [-netProfile &lt;string>]

##unset appflow collector

Use this command to remove appflow collector settings.Refer to the set appflow collector command for meanings of the arguments.


##Synopsys

unset appflow collector &lt;name> [-IPAddress] [-port] [-netProfile]


##rm appflow collector

Removes an AppFlow collector. You cannot remove a collector if it is associated with an AppFlow action.


##Synopsys

rm appflow collector &lt;name>


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name of the collector to remove.



##Example

rm appflow collector collector1

##rename appflow collector

Renames an AppFlow collector.

rename appflow collector &lt;name>@ &lt;newName>@


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Existing name of the collector.

<b>newName</b>
New name for the collector. Must begin with an ASCII alphabetic or underscore (_) character, and must
contain only ASCII alphanumeric, underscore, hash (#), period (.), space, colon (:), at(@), equals (=), and hyphen (-) characters. 
The following requirement applies only to the NetScaler CLI:
If the name includes one or more spaces, enclose the name in double or single quotation marks (for example, "my appflow coll" or 'my appflow coll').



##Example

rename appflow collector old_name new_name

##show appflow collector
