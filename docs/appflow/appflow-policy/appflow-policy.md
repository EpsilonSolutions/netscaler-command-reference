Expression or other value against which the traffic is evaluated. Must be a Boolean, default syntax expression.  Note:
Maximum length of a string literal in the expression is 255 characters. A longer string can be split into smaller strings of up to 255 characters each, and the smaller strings concatenated with the + operator.
