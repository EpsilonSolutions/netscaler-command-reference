##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name for the profile. Must begin with a letter, number, or the underscore character (_), and must contain only letters, numbers, and the hyphen (-), period (.), pound (#), space ( ), at (@), equals (=), colon (:), and underscore (_) characters. Cannot be changed after the profile is added.
The following requirement applies only to the NetScaler CLI:
If the name includes one or more spaces, enclose the name in double or single quotation marks (for example, "my profile" or 'my profile').

<b>defaults</b>
Default configuration to apply to the profile. Basic defaults are intended for standard content that requires little further configuration, such as static web site content. Advanced defaults are intended for specialized content that requires significant specialized configuration, such as heavily scripted or dynamic content.
CLI users: When adding an application firewall profile, you can set either the defaults or the type, but not both. To set both options, create the profile by using the add appfw profile command, and then use the set appfw profile command to configure the other option.
Possible values: basic, advanced

<b>builtinType</b>
Type of built-in profile. Determines which security checks and settings are used for the profile. (The type specified by the HTML XML setting is also called "Web 2.0.")
CLI users: When adding an application firewall profile, you can set either the defaults or the type, but not both. To set both options, create the profile by using the add appfw profile command, and then use the set appfw profile command to configure the other option.
Possible values: APPFW_NOT_BUILTIN, APPFW_BYPASS, APPFW_BLOCK, APPFW_RESET, APPFW_DROP

<b>startURLAction</b>
One or more Start URL actions. Available settings function as follows:

Default value: AS_DEFAULT_DISPOSITION

<b>contentTypeAction</b>
One or more Content-type actions. Available settings function as follows:
* Block - Block connections that violate this security check.
* Log - Log violations of this security check.
* None - Disable all actions for this security check.
CLI users: To enable one or more actions, type "set appfw profile -contentTypeaction" followed by the actions to be enabled. To turn off all actions, type "set appfw profile -contentTypeaction none".
