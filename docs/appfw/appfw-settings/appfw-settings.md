##Arguments

<b>defaultProfile</b>
Profile to use when a connection does not match any policy. Default setting is APPFW_BYPASS, which sends unmatched connections back to the NetScaler appliance without attempting to filter them further.
Default value: APPFW_BYPASS

An UNDEF event indicates an internal error condition. The APPFW_BLOCK built-in profile is the default setting. You can specify a different built-in or user-created profile as the UNDEF profile.
Default value: APPFW_BLOCK

<b>sessionTimeout</b>
Timeout, in seconds, after which a user session is terminated. Before continuing to use the protected web site, the user must establish a new session by opening a designated start URL.
Default value: 900 
Minimum value: 1
Maximum value: 65535

<b>learnRateLimit</b>
Maximum number of connections per second that the application firewall learning engine examines to generate new relaxations for learning-enabled security checks. The application firewall drops any connections above this limit from the list of connections used by the learning engine.
Default value: 400 
Minimum value: 1
Maximum value: 1000

<b>sessionLifetime</b>
Maximum amount of time (in seconds) that the application firewall allows a user session to remain active, regardless of user activity. After this time, the user session is terminated. Before continuing to use the protected web site, the user must establish a new session by opening a designated start URL.
Default value: 0

The following requirement applies only to the NetScaler CLI:
If the name includes one or more spaces, enclose the name in double or single quotation marks (for example, "my cookie name" or 'my cookie name').
Default value: NS_S_AS_DEFAULT_COOKIE_NAME

<b>clientIPLoggingHeader</b>
Name of an HTTP header that contains the IP address that the client used to connect to the protected web site or service.

<b>importSizeLimit</b>
Cumulative total maximum number of bytes in web forms imported to a protected web site. If a user attempts to upload files with a total byte count higher than the specified limit, the application firewall blocks the request.
Default value: 134217728
