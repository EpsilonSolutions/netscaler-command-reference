##add responder policy

Creates a responder policy, which specifies requests that the NetScaler appliance intercepts and responds to directly instead of forwarding them to a protected server.


##Synopsys

add responder policy &lt;name> &lt;rule> &lt;action> [&lt;undefAction>] [-comment &lt;string>] [-logAction &lt;string>] [-appflowAction &lt;string>]


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name for the responder policy.
Must begin with a letter, number, or the underscore character (_), and must contain only letters, numbers, and the hyphen (-), period (.) pound (#), space ( ), at (@), equals (=), colon (:), and underscore characters. Can be changed after the responder policy is added.
The following requirement applies only to the NetScaler CLI:
If the name includes one or more spaces, enclose the name in double or single quotation marks (for example, "my responder policy" or 'my responder policy').

<b>rule</b>
Default syntax expression that the policy uses to determine whether to respond to the specified request.

<b>action</b>
Name of the responder action to perform if the request matches this responder policy. There are also some built-in actions which can be used. These are:
* NOOP - Send the request to the protected server instead of responding to it.
* RESET - Reset the client connection by closing it. The client program, such as a browser, will handle this and may inform the user. The client may then resend the request if desired.
* DROP - Drop the request without sending a response to the user.

Action to perform if the result of policy evaluation is undefined (UNDEF). An UNDEF event indicates an internal error condition. Only the above built-in actions can be used.
