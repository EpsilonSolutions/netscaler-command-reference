#HA node

The following operations can be performed on "HA node":


[add](#add-ha-node) | [rm](#rm-ha-node) | [set](#set-ha-node) | [unset](#unset-ha-node) | [bind](#bind-ha-node) | [unbind](#unbind-ha-node) | [show](#show-ha-node) | [stat](#stat-ha-node)

##add HA node

Adds a peer node to an HA configuration. Each node must add the other as a peer. An algorithm determines which node becomes primary and which becomes secondary.


##Synopsys

add HA node &lt;id> &lt;IPAddress> [-inc ( ENABLED | DISABLED )]


##Arguments

<b>id</b>
Number that uniquely identifies the node. For self node, it will always be 0. Peer node values can range from 1-64.
Minimum value: 1
Maximum value: 64

<b>IPAddress</b>
The NSIP or NSIP6 address of the node to be added for an HA configuration. This setting is neither propagated nor synchronized.

<b>inc</b>
This option is required if the HA nodes reside on different networks. When this mode is enabled, the following independent network entities and configurations are neither propagated nor synced to the other node: MIPs, SNIPs, VLANs, routes (except LLB routes), route monitors, RNAT rules (except any RNAT rule with a VIP as the NAT IP), and dynamic routing configurations. They are maintained independently on each node.
Possible values: ENABLED, DISABLED
Default value: DISABLED



##rm HA node

Removes the peer node from the HA configuration. To completely remove both the nodes from the HA configuration, you have to log on to each node and remove its peer node.


##Synopsys

rm HA node &lt;id>


##Arguments

<b>id</b>
Number that uniquely identifies the peer node.
CLI users: To learn the ID of the peer node, run the show HA node command on the local node.
Minimum value: 0
Maximum value: 64



##set HA node

Sets the specified HA related parameters for the node. The settings are neither propagated nor synchronized to the peer node.


##Synopsys

set HA node [-haStatus &lt;haStatus>] [-haSync ( ENABLED | DISABLED )] [-haProp ( ENABLED | DISABLED )] [-helloInterval &lt;msecs>] [-deadInterval &lt;secs>] [-failSafe ( ON | OFF )] [-maxFlips &lt;positive_integer>] [-maxFlipTime &lt;positive_integer>] [-syncvlan &lt;positive_integer>]


##Arguments

<b>haStatus</b>
The HA status of the node. The HA status STAYSECONDARY is used to force the secondary device stay as secondary independent of the state of the Primary device. For example, in an existing HA setup, the Primary node has to be upgraded and this process would take few seconds. During the upgradation, it is possible that the Primary node may suffer from a downtime for a few seconds. However, the Secondary should not take over as the Primary node. Thus, the Secondary node should remain as Secondary even if there is a failure in the Primary node.
	 STAYPRIMARY configuration keeps the node in primary state in case if it is healthy, even if the peer node was the primary node initially. If the node with STAYPRIMARY setting (and no peer node) is added to a primary node (which has this node as the peer) then this node takes over as the new primary and the older node becomes secondary. ENABLED state means normal HA operation without any constraints/preferences. DISABLED state disables the normal HA operation of the node.
Possible values: ENABLED, STAYSECONDARY, DISABLED, STAYPRIMARY

<b>haSync</b>
Automatically maintain synchronization by duplicating the configuration of the primary node on the secondary node. This setting is not propagated. Automatic synchronization requires that this setting be enabled (the default) on the current secondary node. Synchronization uses TCP port 3010.
Possible values: ENABLED, DISABLED
Default value: ENABLED

<b>haProp</b>
Automatically propagate all commands from the primary to the secondary node, except the following:
* All HA configuration related commands. For example, add ha node, set ha node, and bind ha node. 
* All Interface related commands. For example, set interface and unset interface.
* All channels related commands. For example, add channel, set channel, and bind channel.
The propagated command is executed on the secondary node before it is executed on the primary. If command propagation fails, or if command execution fails on the secondary, the primary node executes the command and logs an error.  Command propagation uses port 3010.
Note: After enabling propagation, run force synchronization on either node.
Possible values: ENABLED, DISABLED
Default value: ENABLED

<b>helloInterval</b>
Interval, in milliseconds, between heartbeat messages sent to the peer node. The heartbeat messages are UDP packets sent to port 3003 of the peer node.
Default value: 200
Minimum value: 200
Maximum value: 1000

<b>deadInterval</b>
Number of seconds after which a peer node is marked DOWN if heartbeat messages are not received from the peer node.
Default value: 3
Minimum value: 3
Maximum value: 60

<b>failSafe</b>
Keep one node primary if both nodes fail the health check, so that a partially available node can back up data and handle traffic. This mode is set independently on each node.
Possible values: ON, OFF
Default value: OFF

<b>maxFlips</b>
Max number of flips allowed before becoming sticky primary
Default value: 0
Minimum value: 0

##Outputs

<b>High Availability (HA)</b>
Whether a NetScaler appliance is configured for high availability. Possible values are YES and NO. If the value is NO, the high availability statistics below are invalid.

<b>System state (HAState)</b>
State of the HA node, based on its health, in a high availability setup. Possible values are: 
UP ? Indicates that the node is accessible and can function as either a primary or secondary node.
DISABLED ? Indicates that the high availability status of the node has been manually disabled. Synchronization and propagation cannot take place between the peer nodes.
INIT ? Indicates that the node is in the process of becoming part of the high availability configuration. 
PARTIALFAIL ? Indicates that one of the high availability monitored interfaces has failed because of a card or link failure. This state triggers a failover.
COMPLETEFAIL ? Indicates that all the interfaces of the node are unusable, because the interfaces on which high availability monitoring is enabled are not connected or are manually disabled. This state triggers a failover.
DUMB ? Indicates that the node is in listening mode. It does not participate in high availability transitions or transfer configuration from the peer node. This is a configured value, not a statistic.
PARTIALFAILSSL ? Indicates that the SSL card has failed. This state triggers a failover.
ROUTEMONITORFAIL ? Indicates that the route monitor has failed. This state triggers a failover.

<b>Master state (mastate)</b>
Indicates the high availability state of the node. Possible values are: 
STAYSECONDARY ? Indicates that the selected node remains the secondary node in a high availability setup. In this case a forced failover does not change the state but, instead, returns an appropriate error message. This is a configured value and not a statistic.
PRIMARY ? Indicates that the selected node is the primary node in a high availability setup. 
SECONDARY ? Indicates that the selected node is the secondary node in a high availability setup. 
CLAIMING ? Indicates that the secondary node is in the process of taking over as the primary node. This is the intermediate state in the transition of the secondary node to primary status. 
FORCE CHANGE - Indicates that the secondary node is forcibly changing its status to primary due to a forced failover issued on the secondary node.

<b>Last Transition time (TransTime)</b>
Time when the last master state transition occurred. You can use this statistic for debugging.

<b>Heartbeats received (HApktrx)</b>
Number of heartbeat packets received from the peer node. Heartbeats are sent at regular intervals (default is 200 milliseconds) to determine the state of the peer node.

<b>Heartbeats sent (HApkttx)</b>
Number of heartbeat packets sent to the peer node. Heartbeats are sent at regular intervals (default is 200 milliseconds) to determine the state of the peer node.

<b>Propagation timeouts (ptimeout)</b>
Number of times propagation timed out.

<b>Sync failure (syncfail)</b>
Number of times the configuration of the primary and secondary nodes failed to synchronize since that last transition. A synchronization failure results in mismatched configuration. It can be caused by a mismatch in the Remote Procedural Call (RPC) password on the two nodes forming the high availability pair.
