<b>priority</b>

<b>gotoPriorityExpression</b>
Expression or other value specifying the next policy to be evaluated if the current policy evaluates to TRUE.  Specify one of the following values:
* NEXT ~V Evaluate the policy with the next higher priority number.

* USE_INVOCATION_RESULT ~V Applicable if this policy invokes another policy label. If the final goto in the invoked policy label has a value of END, the eval* USE_INVOCATION_RESULT ~V Applicable if this policy invokes another policy label. If the final goto in the invoked policy label has a value of END, the eval
uation stops. If the final goto is anything other than END, the current policy label performs a NEXT.
* A default syntax expression that evaluates to a number.
If you specify an expression, the number to which it evaluates determines the next policy to evaluate, as follows:
* If the expression evaluates to a higher numbered priority, the policy with that priority is evaluated next.
* If the expression evaluates to the priority of the current policy, the policy with the next higher numbered priority is evaluated next.
* If the expression evaluates to a priority number that is numerically higher than the highest numbered priority, policy evaluation ends.
An UNDEF event is triggered if:
* The expression is invalid.
* The expression evaluates to a priority number that is numerically lower than the current policy~Rs priority.
* The expression evaluates to a priority number that is between the current policy~Rs priority number (say, 30) and the highest priority number (say, 100), b
ut does not match any configured priority number (for example, the expression evaluates to the number 85). This example assumes that the priority number incr
ements by 10 for every successive policy, and therefore a priority number of 85 does not exist in the policy label.

Use the client?s IP address as the source IP address in requests sent to the origin server.  
Note: You can enable this parameter to implement fully transparent CR deployment.

<b>RHIstate</b>
A host route is injected according to the setting on the virtual servers
            * If set to PASSIVE on all the virtual servers that share the IP address, the appliance always injects the hostroute.
            * If set to ACTIVE on all the virtual servers that share the IP address, the appliance injects even if one virtual server is UP.
            * If set to ACTIVE on some virtual servers and PASSIVE on the others, the appliance, injects even if one virtual server set to ACTIVE is UP.
