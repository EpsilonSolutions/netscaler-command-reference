<b>Spare connections (SpConn)</b>
Spare connections available. To save time and resources in establishing another connection for a new client, the connection on the server is not closed after completing the request from the first client and is available for serving future requests.

<b>Seq number SYN cookie reject (CSeqRej)</b>
SYN cookie packets rejected because they contain an incorrect sequence number.

<b>Signature SYN cookie reject (CSigRej)</b>
SYN cookie packets rejected because they contain an incorrect signature.

<b>SYNs dropped (Congestion) (SynCng)</b>
SYN packets dropped because of network congestion.

SYN packets resent to a server.

<b>SYN packets timeout (TCPSYNG)</b>
Attempts to establish a connection on the NetScaler that timed out.

<b>Server retransmissions (TCPSvrRe)</b>
Packets retransmitted by a server. This usually occurs because the acknowledgement from the NetScaler has not reached the server.

<b>Partial packet retransmissions (TCPParRe)</b>
Partial packet retransmits by a client or server due to congestion on the connection. This usually occurs because the window advertised by the NetScaler is not big enough to hold the full packet.

<b>FIN packet retries (TCPFINRe)</b>
FIN packets resent to a server or a client.

<b>FIN packets timeout (TCPFING)</b>
Connections that were timed out by the NetScaler because of not receiving the ACK packet after retransmitting the FIN packet four times.
