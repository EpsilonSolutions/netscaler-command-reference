##add tunnel trafficPolicy

Creates a tunnel traffic policy. A tunnel traffic policy defines the type of compression to be used for the tunneled traffic.


##Synopsys

add tunnel trafficPolicy &lt;name> &lt;rule> &lt;action>


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name for the tunnel traffic policy.
Must begin with an ASCII alphanumeric or underscore (_) character, and must contain only ASCII alphanumeric, underscore, hash (#), period (.), space, colon (:), at (@), equals (=), and hyphen (-) characters. Cannot be changed after the policy is created.
The following requirement applies only to the NetScaler CLI:
If the name includes one or more spaces, enclose the name in double or single quotation marks (for example, "my policy" or 'my policy)'.

<b>rule</b>
Expression, against which traffic is evaluated. Written in classic or default syntax.
Maximum length of a string literal in the expression is 255 characters. A longer string can be split into smaller strings of up to 255 characters each, and the smaller strings concatenated with the + operator. For example, you can create a 500-character string as follows: '"&lt;string of 255 characters&gt;" + "&lt;string of 245 characters&gt;"'
The following requirements apply only to the NetScaler CLI:
*  If the expression includes blank spaces, the entire expression must be enclosed in double quotation marks.
*  If the expression itself includes double quotation marks, you must escape the quotations by using the \\ character. 
*  Alternatively, you can use single quotation marks to enclose the rule, in which case you do not have to escape the double quotation marks.

<b>action</b>
Name of the built-in compression action to associate with the policy.



##Example

Example 1:add tunnel trafficpolicy cmp_all_destport "REQ.TCP.DESTPORT == 0-65535" GZIPAfter creating above tunnel policy, it can be activated by binding it globally:bind tunnel global cmp_all_destportThe policy is evaluated for all traffic flowing through the ssl-vpn tunnel, and compresses traffic for all TCP application ports.Example 2:The following tunnel policy disables compression for all access from a specific subnet:add tunnel trafficpolicy local_sub_nocmp "SOURCEIP == 10.1.1.0 -netmask 255.255.255.0" NOCOMPRESSbind tunnel global local_sub_nocmp

##rm tunnel trafficPolicy

Removes a tunnel traffic policy.


##Synopsys

rm tunnel trafficPolicy &lt;name>


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name of the tunnel traffic policy to remove.



##Example

rm tunnel trafficpolicy tunnel_policy_nameThe "show tunnel trafficpolicy" command shows all tunnel policies that are currently defined.

##set tunnel trafficPolicy

Modifies the specified parameters of an existing tunnel traffic policy.


##Synopsys

set tunnel trafficPolicy &lt;name> [-rule &lt;expression>] [-action &lt;string>]


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name of the tunnel traffic policy to modify.

<b>rule</b>
Expression, against which traffic is evaluated. Written in classic or default syntax.

##Example
