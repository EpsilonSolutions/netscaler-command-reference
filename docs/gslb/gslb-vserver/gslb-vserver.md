Type of threshold that, when exceeded, triggers spillover. Available settings function as follows:
* CONNECTION - Spillover occurs when the number of client connections exceeds the threshold.
* DYNAMICCONNECTION - Spillover occurs when the number of client connections at the GSLB virtual server exceeds the sum of the maximum client (Max Clients) settings for bound GSLB services. Do not specify a spillover threshold for this setting, because the threshold is implied by the Max Clients settings of the bound GSLB services.
* BANDWIDTH - Spillover occurs when the bandwidth consumed by the GSLB virtual server's incoming and outgoing traffic exceeds the threshold. 
* HEALTH - Spillover occurs when the percentage of weights of the GSLB services that are UP drops below the threshold. For example, if services gslbSvc1, gslbSvc2, and gslbSvc3 are bound to a virtual server, with weights 1, 2, and 3, and the spillover threshold is 50%, spillover occurs if gslbSvc1 and gslbSvc3 or gslbSvc2 and gslbSvc3 transition to DOWN. 
* NONE - Spillover does not occur.

<b>soBackupAction</b>
Action to be performed if spillover is to take effect, but no backup chain to spillover is usable or exists

<b>soPersistence</b>
If spillover occurs, maintain source IP address based persistence for both primary and backup GSLB virtual servers.

<b>soThreshold</b>
Threshold at which spillover occurs. Specify an integer for the CONNECTION spillover method, a bandwidth value in kilobits per second for the BANDWIDTH method (do not enter the units), or a percentage for the HEALTH method (do not enter the percentage symbol).

<b>health</b>
Health of vserver based on percentage of weights of active svcs/all svcs. This does not consider administratively disabled svcs

<b>stateflag</b>
stateflag

<b>appflowLog</b>
Enable logging appflow flow information

<b>policyName</b>
Name of the policy bound to the GSLB vserver.

<b>priority</b>
Priority.

<b>gotoPriorityExpression</b>
Expression specifying the priority of the next policy which will get evaluated if the current policy rule evaluates to TRUE.
	o	If gotoPriorityExpression is not present or if it is equal to END then the policy bank evaluation ends here
	o	Else if the gotoPriorityExpression is equal to NEXT then the next policy in the priority order is evaluated.
	o	Else gotoPriorityExpression is evaluated. The result of gotoPriorityExpression (which has to be a number) is processed as follows:
		-	An UNDEF event is triggered if
			.	gotoPriorityExpression cannot be evaluated
			.	gotoPriorityExpression evaluates to number which is smaller than the maximum priority in the policy bank but is not same as any policy's priority
			.	gotoPriorityExpression evaluates to a priority that is smaller than the current policy's priority
		-	If the gotoPriorityExpression evaluates to the priority of the current policy then the next policy in the priority order is evaluated.
		-	If the gotoPriorityExpression evaluates to the priority of a policy further ahead in the list then that policy will be evaluated next.
		This field is applicable only to rewrite and responder policies.
