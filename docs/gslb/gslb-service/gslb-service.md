##Arguments

<b>serviceName</b>
Name for the GSLB service. Must begin with an ASCII alphanumeric or underscore (_) character, and must contain only ASCII alphanumeric, underscore, hash (#), period (.), space, colon (:), at (@), equals (=), and hyphen (-) characters. Can be changed after the GSLB service is created.
CLI Users: If the name includes one or more spaces, enclose the name in double or single quotation marks (for example, "my gslbsvc" or 'my gslbsvc').

<b>cnameEntry</b>
Canonical name of the GSLB service. Used in CNAME-based GSLB.

<b>IP</b>
IP address for the GSLB service. Should represent a load balancing, content switching, or VPN virtual server on the NetScaler appliance, or the IP address of another load balancing device.

<b>serverName</b>
Name of the server hosting the GSLB service.

<b>serviceType</b>
Type of service to create.
Possible values: HTTP, FTP, TCP, UDP, SSL, SSL_BRIDGE, SSL_TCP, NNTP, ANY, SIP_UDP, RADIUS, RDP, RTSP, MYSQL, MSSQL, ORACLE

<b>publicIP</b>
The public IP address that a NAT device translates to the GSLB service's private IP address. Optional.

<b>maxClient</b>
The maximum number of open connections that the service can support at any given time. A GSLB service whose connection count reaches the maximum is not considered when a GSLB decision is made, until the connection count drops below the maximum.
Maximum value: 4294967294

<b>healthMonitor</b>
Monitor the health of the GSLB service.
Possible values: YES, NO
Default value: YES

Possible values: ENABLED, DISABLED
Default value: DISABLED

<b>cipHeader</b>
Name for the HTTP header that stores the client's IP address. Used with the Client IP option. If client IP header insertion is enabled on the service and a name is not specified for the header, the NetScaler appliance uses the name specified by the cipHeader parameter in the set ns param command or, in the GUI, the Client IP Header parameter in the Configure HTTP Parameters dialog box.

When implementing HTTP redirect site persistence, the NetScaler appliance redirects GSLB requests to GSLB services by using their site domains.
