<b>dhKeyExpSizeLimit</b>
This option enables the use of NIST recommended (NIST Special Publication 800-56A) bit size for private-key size. For example, for DH params of size 2048bit, the private-key size recommended is 224bits. This is rounded-up to 256bits.

<b>eRSA</b>
The state of Ephemeral RSA key exchange support for the SSL service group.Ephemeral RSA is used for export ciphers.

<b>cipherURL</b>
The redirect URL to be used with the  Cipher  Redirect  feature.

<b>sslv2Redirect</b>
The state of SSLv2 Redirect feature.SSLv2 Redirect feature can be used to provide more readable information to SSL client about non-support of SSLv2 protocol on the SSL vserver.

<b>sslv2URL</b>

<b>clientAuth</b>
The state of Client-Authentication support for the SSL service group.

<b>clientCert</b>
The rule for client certificate requirement in client authentication.

<b>sslRedirect</b>
The state of HTTPS redirects for the SSL service group.
This is required for the proper functioning of the redirect messages from the server. The redirect message from the server provides the new location for the moved object. This is contained in the HTTP header field: Location, e.g. Location: http://www.moved.org/here.html
For the SSL session, if the client browser receives this message, the browser will try to connect to the new location. This will break the secure SSL session, as the object has moved from a secure site (https://) to an un-secure one (http://). Generally browsers flash a warning message on the screen and prompt the user, either to continue or disconnect.
The above feature, when enabled will automatically convert all such http:// redirect message to https://. This will not break the client SSL session.
Note: The set ssl service command can be used for configuring a front-end SSL service for service based SSL Off-Loading, or a backend SSL service for backend-encryption setup.
