The following operations can be performed on "ssl policy":


[add](#add-ssl-policy) | [rm](#rm-ssl-policy) | [set](#set-ssl-policy) | [unset](#unset-ssl-policy) | [show](#show-ssl-policy)

##add ssl policy

Adds an SSL policy. An SSL policy evaluates incoming traffic and applies a predefined action to requests that match a rule (expression). You have to configure the actions before creating the policies, so that you can specify an action when you create a policy.


##Synopsys

add ssl policy &lt;name> -rule &lt;expression> [-action &lt;string>] [-undefAction &lt;string>] [-comment &lt;string>]


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name for the new SSL policy. Must begin with an ASCII alphanumeric or underscore (_) character, and must contain only ASCII alphanumeric, underscore, hash (#), period (.), space, colon (:), at (@), equals (=), and hyphen (-) characters.  Cannot be changed after the policy is created.
The following requirement applies only to the NetScaler CLI:
If the name includes one or more spaces, enclose the name in double or single quotation marks (for example, "my policy" or 'my policy').

<b>rule</b>
Expression, against which traffic is evaluated. Written in the classic or default syntax.
Note:
Maximum length of a string literal in the expression is 255 characters. A longer string can be split into smaller strings of up to 255 characters each, and the smaller strings concatenated with the + operator. For example, you can create a 500-character string as follows: '"&lt;string of 255 characters&gt;" + "&lt;string of 245 characters&gt;"'
(Classic expressions are not supported in the cluster build.)
The following requirements apply only to the NetScaler CLI:
* If the expression includes one or more spaces, enclose the entire expression in double quotation marks.
* If the expression itself includes double quotation marks, escape the quotations by using the  character. 
* Alternatively, you can use single quotation marks to enclose the rule, in which case you do not have to escape the double quotation marks.

<b>action</b>
Name of the built-in or user-defined action to perform on the request. Available built-in actions are NOOP, RESET, DROP, CLIENTAUTH, and NOCLIENTAUTH.

<b>undefAction</b>

<b>comment</b>

##Example
