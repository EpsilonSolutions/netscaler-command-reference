#ssl action

The following operations can be performed on "ssl action":


[add](#add-ssl-action) | [rm](#rm-ssl-action) | [show](#show-ssl-action)

##add ssl action

Creates a new SSL action. An SSL action defines SSL settings that you can apply to the selected requests. You associate an action with one or more policies. Data in client connection requests or responses is compared to a rule (expression) specified in the policy, and the action is applied to connections that match the rule.

##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name for the SSL action. Must begin with an ASCII alphanumeric or underscore (_) character, and must contain only ASCII alphanumeric, underscore, hash (#), period (.), space, colon (:), at (@), equals (=), and hyphen (-) characters. Cannot be changed after the action is created.
The following requirement applies only to the NetScaler CLI:
If the name includes one or more spaces, enclose the name in double or single quotation marks (for example, "my action" or 'my action').

<b>clientCertFingerprint</b>
Insert the certificate's fingerprint into the HTTP header of the request being sent to the web server. The fingerprint is derived by computing the specified hash value (SHA256, for example) of the DER-encoding of the client certificate.

<b>sessionIDHeader</b>
Name of the header into which to insert the Session ID.

<b>cipher</b>
Insert the cipher suite that the client and the NetScaler appliance negotiated for the SSL session into the HTTP header of the request being sent to the web server. The appliance inserts the cipher-suite name, SSL protocol, export or non-export string, and cipher strength bit, depending on the type of browser connecting to the SSL virtual server or service (for example, Cipher-Suite: RC4- MD5 SSLv3 Non-Export 128-bit).
Possible values: ENABLED, DISABLED

<b>cipherHeader</b>
Name of the header into which to insert the name of the cipher suite.

<b>clientCertNotBefore</b>
Insert the date from which the certificate is valid into the HTTP header of the request being sent to the web server. Every certificate is configured with the date and time from which it is valid.
Possible values: ENABLED, DISABLED

<b>certNotBeforeHeader</b>
Name of the header into which to insert the date and time from which the certificate is valid.

<b>clientCertNotAfter</b>
Insert the date of expiry of the certificate into the HTTP header of the request being sent to the web server. Every certificate is configured with the date and time at which the certificate expires.
Possible values: ENABLED, DISABLED

<b>certNotAfterHeader</b>
Name of the header into which to insert the certificate's expiry date.

<b>OWASupport</b>
If the appliance is in front of an Outlook Web Access (OWA) server, insert a special header field, FRONT-END-HTTPS: ON, into the HTTP requests going to the OWA server. This header communicates to the server that the transaction is HTTPS and not HTTP.
Possible values: ENABLED, DISABLED
