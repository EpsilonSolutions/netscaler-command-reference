#vlan

The following operations can be performed on "vlan":


[add](#add-vlan) | [rm](#rm-vlan) | [set](#set-vlan) | [unset](#unset-vlan) | [bind](#bind-vlan) | [unbind](#unbind-vlan) | [show](#show-vlan) | [stat](#stat-vlan)

##add vlan

Adds a VLAN to the NetScaler appliance.The newVLAN is not active unless interfaces are bound to it.


##Synopsys

add vlan &lt;id> [-aliasName &lt;string>] [-dynamicRouting ( ENABLED | DISABLED )] [-ipv6DynamicRouting ( ENABLED | DISABLED )] [-mtu &lt;positive_integer>]


##Arguments

<b>id</b>
A positive integer that uniquely identifies a VLAN.
Minimum value: 1
Maximum value: 4094

<b>aliasName</b>
A name for the VLAN. Must begin with a letter, a number, or the underscore symbol, and can consist of from 1 to 31 letters, numbers, and the hyphen (-), period (.) pound (#), space ( ), at sign (@), equals (=), colon (:), and underscore (_) characters. You should choose a name that helps identify the VLAN. However, you cannot perform any VLAN operation by specifying this name instead of the VLAN ID.

<b>dynamicRouting</b>
Enable dynamic routing on this VLAN.
Possible values: ENABLED, DISABLED

##bind vlan

Binds the specified interfaces or IP addresses to a VLAN. An interface can be bound to a VLAN as a tagged or an untagged member.

If an interface is added as a tagged member to a VLAN, it still remains a member of its native VLAN.
