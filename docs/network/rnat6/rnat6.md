##add rnat6

Adds a Reverse Network Address Translation (RNAT6) rule for IPv6 traffic. When an IPv6 packet generated by a server matches the conditions specified in the RNAT6 rule, the appliance replaces the source IPv6 address of the IPv6 packet with a configured NAT IPv6 address before forwarding it to the destination.


##Synopsys

add rnat6 &lt;name> (&lt;network> | (&lt;acl6name>  [-redirectPort &lt;port>])) [-td &lt;positive_integer>] [-srcippersistency ( ENABLED | DISABLED )]


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name for the RNAT6 rule. Must begin with a letter, number, or the underscore character (_), and can consist of letters, numbers, and the hyphen (-), period (.) pound (#), space ( ), at sign (@), equals (=), colon (:), and underscore characters. Cannot be changed after the rule is created. Choose a name that helps identify the RNAT6 rule.

<b>network</b>
IPv6 address of the network on whose traffic you want the NetScaler appliance to do RNAT processing.

<b>acl6name</b>
Name of any configured ACL6 whose action is ALLOW. The rule of the ACL6 is used as an RNAT6 rule.

<b>redirectPort</b>
Port number to which the IPv6 packets are redirected. Applicable to TCP and UDP protocols.
Minimum value: 1
Maximum value: 65535

<b>td</b>
Integer value that uniquely identifies the traffic domain in which you want to configure the entity. If you do not specify an ID, the entity becomes part of the default traffic domain, which has an ID of 0.
Minimum value: 0
Maximum value: 4094

<b>srcippersistency</b>
Enable source ip persistency, which enables the NetScaler appliance to use the RNAT ips using source ip.
Possible values: ENABLED, DISABLED
Default value: DISABLED



##Example

add rnat6 rnat6_name 2002::/64

##bind rnat6

##unbind rnat6

Unbinds the associated NAT IPv6 address(es) from an RNAT6 rule.


##Synopsys

unbind rnat6 &lt;name> &lt;natIP6>@ ...


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name of the RNAT6 rule from which to unbind the associated NAT IP address(es).

<b>natIP6</b>
IP address, or multiple addresses, to be unbound from the RNAT6rule. (If using the CLI, use spaces to separate multiple addresses.)



##Example

unbind rnat6 &lt;rnat6_name&gt; &lt;natIP6&gt;@ ...

##set rnat6

Modifies the specified parameters of an RNAT6 rule.


##Synopsys

set rnat6 &lt;name> [-redirectPort &lt;port>] [-srcippersistency ( ENABLED | DISABLED )]


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name of the RNAT6 rule. Required for identifying the RNAT6 rule and cannot be modified.

Port number to which the IPv6 packets are redirected. Applicable to TCP and UDP protocols.
Minimum value: 1
Maximum value: 65535

<b>srcippersistency</b>
Enable source ip persistency, which enables the NetScaler appliance to use the RNAT6 ips using source ip.
Possible values: ENABLED, DISABLED
Default value: DISABLED



##unset rnat6
