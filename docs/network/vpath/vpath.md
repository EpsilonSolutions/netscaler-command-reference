[add](#add-vpath) | [rm](#rm-vpath) | [show](#show-vpath) | [stat](#stat-vpath)

##add vpath

Adds vPath destination IP to which packets need to be vPath injected.


##Synopsys

add vpath &lt;name> (&lt;destIP>  [&lt;netmask>]  [&lt;gateway>])


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name for the vPath. Must begin with a letter, number, or the underscore character (_), and can consist of letters, numbers, and the hyphen (-), period (.) pound (#), space ( ), at sign (@), equals (=), colon (:), and underscore characters. Cannot be changed after the profile is created. Choose a name that helps identify the net profile.

<b>destIP</b>
This is the destination ip, where vPath encapsulated packets needs to be sent

<b>netmask</b>
Subnet mask associated with the destination network.

<b>gateway</b>
Next hop gateway to reach the destination address.



##Example

add vpath vPath1 -destip 10.102.1.10 

##rm vpath

Remove vPath destination IP.


##Synopsys

rm vpath &lt;name> ...


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name of the vPath to be removed.



##Example

rm netProfile prof1

##show vpath

List down all vPath destination IPs.


##Synopsys

show vpath [&lt;name>]


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name of the vPath whose details you want to display.



##Outputs

<b>destIP</b>
This is the destination ip, where vPath encapsulated packets needs to be sent

<b>netmask</b>
Subnet mask associated with the destination network.

<b>gateway</b>
Next hop gateway to reach the destination address.

<b>devno</b>

<b>count</b>

<b>stateflag</b>



##Example

show vpath

##stat vpath

Display vPath statistics.


##Synopsys

stat vpath [-detail] [-fullValues] [-ntimes &lt;positive_integer>] [-logFile &lt;input_filename>] [-clearstats ( basic | full )]


##Arguments

<b>detail</b>
Specifies detailed output (including more statistics). The output can be quite voluminous. Without this argument, the output will show only a summary.

<b>fullValues</b>
Specifies that numbers and strings should be displayed in their full form. Without this option, long strings are shortened and large numbers are abbreviated

<b>ntimes</b>
The number of times, in intervals of seven seconds, the statistics should be displayed.
Default value: 1
Minimum value: 0

<b>logFile</b>
The name of the log file to be used as input.

<b>clearstats</b>
Clear the statsistics / counters
Possible values: basic, full
