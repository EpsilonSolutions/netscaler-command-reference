Priority number to assign to the mail exchange server. A domain name can have multiple mail servers, with a priority number assigned to each server. The lower the priority number, the higher the mail server's priority. When other mail servers have to deliver mail to the specified domain, they begin with the mail server with the lowest priority number, and use other configured mail servers, in priority order, as backups.

For example, if you add an address record, with a TTL of 36000, to the domain name example.com, the TTLs of all the address records of example.com are changed to 36000. If the TTL is not specified, the NetScaler appliance uses either the DNS zone's minimum TTL or, if the SOA record is not available on the appliance, the default value of 3600.
