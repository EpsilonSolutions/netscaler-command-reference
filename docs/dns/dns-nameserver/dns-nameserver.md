#dns nameServer

The following operations can be performed on "dns nameServer":


[add](#add-dns-nameserver) | [rm](#rm-dns-nameserver) | [enable](#enable-dns-nameserver) | [disable](#disable-dns-nameserver) | [show](#show-dns-nameserver)

##add dns nameServer

Adds a name server to the appliance. Following are the two types of name servers that can be added:* IP address-based name server - An external name server to contact for domain name resolution. If multiple IP address-based name servers are configured on the appliance, and the local parameter is not set on any of them, incoming DNS queries are load balanced across all the name servers, in round robin fashion.* Virtual server-based name server - A DNS virtual server configured in the NetScaler appliance. If you want more fine-grained control on how external DNS name servers are load balanced (for example, you want a load balancing method other than round robin), you configure a DNS virtual server on the appliance, bind the external name servers as its services, and then specify the name of the virtual server in this command.


##Synopsys

add dns nameServer ((&lt;IP>  [-local]) | &lt;dnsVserverName>) [-state ( ENABLED | DISABLED )] [-type &lt;type>]


##Arguments

<b>IP</b>
IP address of an external name server or, if the Local parameter is set, IP address of a local DNS server (LDNS).

<b>dnsVserverName</b>
Name of a DNS virtual server. Overrides any IP address-based name servers configured on the NetScaler appliance.

<b>local</b>
Mark the IP address as one that belongs to a local recursive DNS server on the NetScaler appliance. The appliance recursively resolves queries received on an IP address that is marked as being local. For recursive resolution to work, the global DNS parameter, Recursion, must also be set. 
If no name server is marked as being local, the appliance functions as a stub resolver and load balances the name servers.

<b>state</b>
Administrative state of the name server.
Possible values: ENABLED, DISABLED
Default value: ENABLED

<b>type</b>
Protocol used by the name server. UDP_TCP is not valid if the name server is a DNS virtual server configured on the appliance.
Possible values: UDP, TCP, UDP_TCP
Default value: NSA_UDP



##Example

Adding an-IP based nameserver IP:	add nameserver 10.102.4.1,Adding a vserver-based name server:	add nameserver dns_vsvrwhere dns_vsvr is the name of a DNS vserver created in the system.

##rm dns nameServer

Removes a name server from the NetScaler appliance. If the name server is an IP-address based external name server, the name server entry is removed. If the name server is a DNS virtual server on the appliance, the virtual server is not removed, but it is no longer used to resolve domain names.

##Arguments
