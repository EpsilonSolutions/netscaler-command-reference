The following operations can be performed on "dns profile":


[add](#add-dns-profile) | [set](#set-dns-profile) | [unset](#unset-dns-profile) | [rm](#rm-dns-profile) | [show](#show-dns-profile)

##add dns profile

Creates a DNS profile. These DNS profiles can be associated with DNS/DNS-TCP LB vservers ,ADNS/ADNS-TCP services , end resolvers and with DNS actions. DNS profiles dictate the caching and logging behavior for a DNS transaction.


##Synopsys

add dns profile &lt;dnsProfileName> [-dnsQueryLogging ( ENABLED | DISABLED )] [-dnsAnswerSecLogging ( ENABLED | DISABLED )] [-dnsExtendedLogging ( ENABLED | DISABLED )] [-dnsErrorLogging ( ENABLED | DISABLED )] [-cacheRecords ( ENABLED | DISABLED )] [-cacheNegativeResponses ( ENABLED | DISABLED )]


##Arguments

<b>dnsProfileName</b>
Name of the DNS profile

<b>dnsQueryLogging</b>
DNS query logging; if enabled, DNS query information such as DNS query id, DNS query flags , DNS domain name and DNS query type will be logged
Possible values: ENABLED, DISABLED
Default value: DISABLED

<b>dnsAnswerSecLogging</b>
DNS answer section; if enabled, answer section in the response will be logged.
Possible values: ENABLED, DISABLED
Default value: DISABLED

<b>dnsExtendedLogging</b>
DNS extended logging; if enabled, authority and additional section in the response will be logged.
Possible values: ENABLED, DISABLED
Default value: DISABLED

<b>dnsErrorLogging</b>
DNS error logging; if enabled, whenever error is encountered in DNS module reason for the error will be logged.
Possible values: ENABLED, DISABLED
Default value: DISABLED

<b>cacheRecords</b>
Cache resource records in the DNS cache. Applies to resource records obtained through proxy configurations only. End resolver and forwarder configurations always cache records in the DNS cache, and you cannot disable this behavior. When you disable record caching, the appliance stops caching server responses. However, cached records are not flushed. The appliance does not serve requests from the cache until record caching is enabled again.
Possible values: ENABLED, DISABLED
Default value: ENABLED

<b>cacheNegativeResponses</b>
Cache negative responses in the DNS cache. When disabled, the appliance stops caching negative responses except referral records. This applies to all configurations - proxy, end resolver, and forwarder. However, cached responses are not flushed. The appliance does not serve negative responses from the cache until this parameter is enabled again.
Possible values: ENABLED, DISABLED
Default value: ENABLED



##Example

add dns profile testprofile -caching yes

##set dns profile

Modifies the attributes of a DNS profile.
