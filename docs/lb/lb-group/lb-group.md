##set lb group

Configures persistence for the specified load balancing group. The persistence settings are applied to all the members of the group.


##Synopsys

set lb group &lt;name>@ [-persistenceType &lt;persistenceType>] [-persistenceBackup ( SOURCEIP | NONE )] [-backupPersistenceTimeout &lt;mins>] [-persistMask &lt;netmask>] [-cookieName &lt;string>] [-v6persistmasklen &lt;positive_integer>] [-cookieDomain &lt;string>] [-timeout &lt;mins>] [-rule &lt;expression>]


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name of the load balancing virtual server group.

<b>persistenceType</b>
Type of persistence for the group. Available settings function as follows:
* SOURCEIP - Create persistence sessions based on the client IP.
* COOKIEINSERT - Create persistence sessions based on a cookie in client requests. The cookie is inserted by a Set-Cookie directive from the server, in its first response to a client.
* RULE - Create persistence sessions based on a user defined rule.
* NONE - Disable persistence for the group.
Possible values: SOURCEIP, COOKIEINSERT, RULE, NONE

<b>persistenceBackup</b>
Type of backup persistence for the group.
Possible values: SOURCEIP, NONE

<b>backupPersistenceTimeout</b>
Time period, in minutes, for which backup persistence is in effect.
Default value: 2
Minimum value: 2
Maximum value: 1440

<b>persistMask</b>
Persistence mask to apply to source IPv4 addresses when creating source IP based persistence sessions.
Default value: 0xFFFFFFFF

<b>cookieName</b>
Use this parameter to specify the cookie name for COOKIE peristence type. It specifies the name of cookie with a maximum of 32 characters. If not specified, cookie name is internally generated.

<b>v6persistmasklen</b>
Persistence mask to apply to source IPv6 addresses when creating source IP based persistence sessions.
Default value: 128
Minimum value: 1
Maximum value: 128

<b>cookieDomain</b>
Domain attribute for the HTTP cookie.

<b>timeout</b>
Time period for which a persistence session is in effect.
Default value: 2
Maximum value: 1440

<b>rule</b>
Expression, or name of a named expression, against which traffic is evaluated. Written in the classic or default syntax.
Note:
Maximum length of a string literal in the expression is 255 characters. A longer string can be split into smaller strings of up to 255 characters each, and the smaller strings concatenated with the + operator. For example, you can create a 500-character string as follows: '"&lt;string of 255 characters&gt;" + "&lt;string of 245 characters&gt;"'
The following requirements apply only to the NetScaler CLI:
* If the expression includes one or more spaces, enclose the entire expression in double quotation marks.
* If the expression itself includes double quotation marks, escape the quotations by using the \\ character. 
* Alternatively, you can use single quotation marks to enclose the rule, in which case you do not have to escape the double quotation marks.
Default value: "None"



##Example

set lb group webgrp -persistenceType COOKIEINSERT	To set the persistence type for multiple groups use the following command:       set lb group webgrp[1-3] -persistenceType COOKIEINSERT

##unset lb group

Use this command to remove lb group settings.Refer to the set lb group command for meanings of the arguments.


##Synopsys

unset lb group &lt;name>@ [-persistenceType] [-persistenceBackup] [-backupPersistenceTimeout] [-persistMask] [-cookieName] [-v6persistmasklen] [-cookieDomain] [-timeout] [-rule]


##bind lb group

Binds one or more virtual servers to a load balancing virtual server group. If the specified group does not exist, the NetScaler appliance first creates the group, and then binds the virtual servers to it. A virtual server group enables you to specify common persistence settings for all of its members through a single set lb group command. Only address-based virtual servers can be added to a group. Content-based virtual servers (content switching and cache redirection virtual servers) cannot be added. A virtual server can be assigned to only one group at any given time. To move a virtual server from one group to another, the virtual server must first be unbound from the group to which it belongs.


##Synopsys

bind lb group &lt;name>@ &lt;vServerName>@ ...


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name for the load balancing virtual server group. Must begin with an ASCII alphanumeric or underscore (_) character, and must contain only ASCII alphanumeric, underscore, hash (#), period (.), space, colon (:), at (@), equals (=), and hyphen (-) characters. Can be changed after the virtual server is created.
CLI Users: If the name includes one or more spaces, enclose the name in double or single quotation marks (for example, "my lbgroup" or 'my lbgroup').

<b>vServerName</b>
Name of the virtual server to bind to the group. Multiple names can be specified.



##Example

bind lb group webgrp http_vip	To bind multiple vservers to a group use the following command:	bind lb group webgrp v[1-4]	To bind vserver v1 to group webgrp1, v2 to webgrp2 and v3 to webgrp3, use the following command:	bind lb group webgrp[1-3] v[1-3]

##unbind lb group

Unbinds one or more virtual servers from a group. When the last virtual server is unbound, the group is removed.


##Synopsys

unbind lb group &lt;name> &lt;vServerName>@ ...


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name of the load balancing virtual server group.

<b>vServerName</b>
Name of the virtual server to unbind. Multiple names can be specified.



##Example

unbind lb group webgroup http_vip	To unbind multiple vservers use the following command:	unbind lb group webgroup v[1-3]

##show lb group

Displays the virtual servers bound to the specified group.
