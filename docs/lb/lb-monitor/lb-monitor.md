For a monitor of type USER, however, the destination port is the port number that is included in the HTTP request sent to the dispatcher. Does not apply to monitors of type PING.

<b>state</b>
State of the monitor. The DISABLED setting disables not only the monitor being configured, but all monitors of the same type, until the parameter is set to ENABLED.
