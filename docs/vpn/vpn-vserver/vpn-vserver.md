<b>serviceType</b>
Protocol used by the NetScaler Gateway virtual server.
Possible values: SSL
Default value: SSL

<b>IPAddress</b>
IPv4 or IPv6 address of the NetScaler Gateway virtual server. Usually a public IP address. User devices send connection requests to this IP address.

Possible values: ON, OFF
Default value: ON

<b>doubleHop</b>
Use the NetScaler Gateway appliance in a double-hop configuration. A double-hop deployment provides an extra layer of security for the internal network by using three firewalls to divide the DMZ into two stages. Such a deployment can have one appliance in the DMZ and one appliance in the secure network.
Possible values: ENABLED, DISABLED
Default value: DISABLED

<b>maxAAAUsers</b>
Maximum number of concurrent user sessions allowed on this virtual server. The actual number of users allowed to log on to this virtual server depends on the total number of user licenses.
Minimum value: 0

<b>icaOnly</b>
- When set to ON, it implies Basic mode where the user can log on using either Citrix Receiver or a browser and get access to the published apps configured at the XenApp/XenDEsktop environment pointed out by the WIHome parameter. Users are not allowed to connect using the NetScaler Gateway Plug-in and end point scans cannot be configured. Number of users that can log in and access the apps are not limited by the license in this mode.
- When set to OFF, it implies Smart Access mode where the user can log on using either Citrix Receiver or a browser or a NetScaler Gateway Plug-in. The admin can configure end point scans to be run on the client systems and then use the results to control access to the published apps. In this mode, the client can connect to the gateway in other client modes namely VPN and CVPN. Number of users that can log in and access the resources are limited by the CCU licenses in this mode.

Possible values: ENABLED, DISABLED
Default value: ENABLED

Maximum value: 100

<b>tcpProfileName</b>
Name of the TCP profile to assign to this virtual server.

##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name of the virtual server.

<b>policy</b>
Name of a policy to bind to the virtual server (for example, the name of an authentication, session, or endpoint analysis policy).

<b>priority</b>
Integer specifying the policy's priority. The lower the number, the higher the priority. Policies are evaluated in the order of their priority numbers. Maximum value for default syntax policies is 2147483647 and for classic policies is 64000.
Minimum value: 0
Maximum value: 2147483647

<b>secondary</b>
Binds the authentication policy as the secondary policy to use in a two-factor configuration. A user must then authenticate not only via a primary authentication method but also via a secondary authentication method. User groups are aggregated across both. The user name must be exactly the same for both authentication methods, but they can require different passwords.

<b>groupExtraction</b>
Binds the authentication policy to a tertiary chain which will be used only for group extraction.  The user will not authenticate against this server, and this will only be called if primary and/or secondary authentication has succeeded.

<b>gotoPriorityExpression</b>
Applicable only to advance vpn session policy. Expression or other value specifying the next policy to evaluate if the current policy evaluates to TRUE.  Specify one of the following values:
* NEXT - Evaluate the policy with the next higher priority number.
* END - End policy evaluation.
* A default syntax or expression that evaluates to a number.
If you specify an expression, the number to which it evaluates determines the next policy to evaluate, as follows:
*  If the expression evaluates to a higher numbered priority, the policy with that priority is evaluated next.
* If the expression evaluates to the priority of the current policy, the policy with the next higher numbered priority is evaluated next.
* If the expression evaluates to a number that is larger than the largest numbered priority, policy evaluation ends.
An UNDEF event is triggered if:
* The expression is invalid.
* The expression evaluates to a priority number that is numerically lower than the current policy's priority.
* The expression evaluates to a priority number that is between the current policy's priority number (say, 30) and the highest priority number (say, 100), but does not match any configured priority number (for example, the expression evaluates to the number 85). This example assumes that the priority number increments by 10 for every successive policy, and therefore a priority number of 85 does not exist in the policy label.

<b>type</b>
Bind point to which to bind the policy. Applies only to rewrite and cache policies. If you do not set this parameter, the policy is bound to REQ_DEFAULT or RES_DEFAULT, depending on whether the policy rule is a response-time or a request-time expression.
Possible values: REQUEST, RESPONSE, ICA_REQUEST, OTHERTCP_REQUEST

<b>value</b>
Indicates whether or not the certificate is bound or if SSL offload is disabled.

<b>port</b>

Virtual server cache type. The options are: TRANSPARENT, REVERSE, and FORWARD.

<b>redirect</b>
The cache redirect policy.
The valid redirect policies are:
l.        CACHE - Directs all requests to the cache.
2.        POLICY - Applies cache redirection policy to determine whether the request should be directed to the cache or origin. This is the default setting.
3.        ORIGIN - Directs all requests to the origin server.

<b>precedence</b>
This argument is used only when configuring content switching on the specified virtual server. This is applicable only
if both the URL and RULE-based policies have been configured on the same virtual server.
It specifies the type of policy (URL or RULE) that takes precedence on the content switching virtual server. The default setting is RULE.
l        URL - In this case, the incoming request is matched against the URL-based policies before the rule-based policies.
l        RULE - In this case, the incoming request is matched against the rule-based policies before the URL-based policies.
For all URL-based policies, the precedence hierarchy is:
1.        Domain and exact URL
2.        Domain, prefix, and suffix
3.        Domain and suffix

Make sure that the domain you specify in the URL does not match the domain specified in the -d domainName argument of the ###add cs policy### command. If the same domain is specified in both arguments, the request will be continuously redirected to the same unavailable virtual server in the system. If so, the user may not get the requested content.

intranet IP addresses for that application. Possible values are CONNECTION or DYNAMICCONNECTION.
CONNECTION means that a static integer value is the hard limit for the spillover threshold. The spillover
threshold is described below. DYNAMICCONNECTION means that the spillover threshold is set according to
the maximum number of connections defined for the VPN virtual server.

<b>soThreshold</b>

for the virtual servers running on the NetScaler. Mapped IP addresses are used by the system to connect to the backend servers.

            * If set to PASSIVE on all the virtual servers that share the IP address, the appliance always injects the hostroute.
            * If set to ACTIVE on all the virtual servers that share the IP address, the appliance injects even if one virtual server is UP.
            * If set to ACTIVE on some virtual servers and PASSIVE on the others, the appliance injects even if one virtual server set to ACTIVE is UP.
