##add ns pbr6

Adds an IPv6 policy based route (PBR6) to the NetScaler appliance. To commit this operation, you must apply the PBR6s.A PBR6 specifies criteria for selecting outgoing IPv6 packets and, typically, a next hop to which to send the selected packets. For example, you can configure the NetScaler appliance to route outgoing packets from a specific IP address or range to a particular next hop router.Note: The NetScaler appliance process PBR6s before processing the RNAT rules.
