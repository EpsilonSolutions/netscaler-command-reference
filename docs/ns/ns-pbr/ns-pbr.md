The following operations can be performed on "ns pbr":


[add](#add-ns-pbr) | [rm](#rm-ns-pbr) | [set](#set-ns-pbr) | [unset](#unset-ns-pbr) | [enable](#enable-ns-pbr) | [disable](#disable-ns-pbr) | [stat](#stat-ns-pbr) | [show](#show-ns-pbr)

##add ns pbr

Adds a policy based route (PBR) to the NetScaler appliance. To commit this operation, you must apply the PBRs.A PBR specifies criteria for selecting outgoing IPv4 packets and, typically, a next hop to which to send the selected packets. For example, you can configure the NetScaler appliance to route outgoing packets from a specific IP address or range to a particular next hop router.Note: The NetScaler appliance process PBRs before processing the RNAT rules.
