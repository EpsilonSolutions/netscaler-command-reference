#ns config

The following operations can be performed on "ns config":


[clear](#clear-ns-config) | [set](#set-ns-config) | [unset](#unset-ns-config) | [save](#save-ns-config) | [show](#show-ns-config) | [diff](#diff-ns-config) | [query](#query-ns-config)

##clear ns config

Clears the NetScaler running configurations based on different levels.


##Synopsys

clear ns config [-force] &lt;level> [-RBAconfig ( YES | NO )]


##Arguments

<b>force</b>
Configurations will be cleared without prompting for confirmation.

<b>level</b>
Types of configurations to be cleared.
* basic: Clears all configurations except the following:
  - NSIP, default route (gateway), MIPs, and SNIPs
  - Network settings (DG, VLAN, RHI and DNS settings)
  - Cluster settings
  - HA node definitions
  - Feature and mode settings
  - nsroot password
* extended: Clears the same configurations as the 'basic' option. In addition, it clears the feature and mode settings.
* full: Clears all configurations except NSIP, default route, and interface settings.
Note: When you clear the configurations through the cluster IP address, by specifying the level as 'full', the cluster is deleted and all cluster nodes become standalone appliances. The 'basic' and 'extended' levels are propagated to the cluster nodes.
Possible values: basic, extended, full

<b>RBAconfig</b>
RBA configurations and TACACS policies bound to system global will not be cleared if RBA is set to NO.This option is applicable only for BASIC level of clear configuration.Default is YES, which will clear rba configurations.
Possible values: YES, NO
Default value: YES



##set ns config

Sets the NetScaler IP address and NetScaler VLAN. To set other NetScaler parameters, use the 'set ns param' command.Note: To change the NSIP address or the NSVLAN of an appliance that is part of a cluster, first remove the appliance from the cluster, change the NSIP or the NSVLAN, and then add the appliance back to the cluster.


##Synopsys

set ns config [-IPAddress &lt;ip_addr>  -netmask &lt;netmask>] [-nsvlan &lt;positive_integer>  -ifnum &lt;interface_name> ...  [-tagged ( YES | NO )]]


##Arguments

<b>ifnum</b>
Interfaces of the appliances that must be bound to the NSVLAN.
Minimum value: 1

<b>tagged</b>
Specifies that the interfaces will be added as 802.1q tagged interfaces. Packets sent on these interface on this VLAN will have an additional 4-byte 802.1q tag which identifies the VLAN.
To use 802.1q tagging, the switch connected to the appliance's interfaces must also be configured for tagging.
Possible values: YES, NO
Default value: YES



##unset ns config

Removes the attributes of the NetScaler appliance. Attributes for which a default value is available revert to their default values. Refer to the 'set ns config' command for a description of the parameters..Refer to the set ns config command for meanings of the arguments.


##Synopsys

unset ns config [-nsvlan] [-IPAddress] [-netmask] [-ifnum] [-tagged]


##save ns config

Save the configurations to the appliances FLASH memory in the /nsconfig/ns.conf file. Backup configuration files are named ns.conf.n. The most recent backup file has the smallest value for n.


##Synopsys

save ns config


##Outputs

<b>message</b>



##show ns config

Displays the following details of the NetScaler appliance:* NetScaler IP address and subnet mask* Number of mapped IP addresses* Identifies the appliance as a standalone appliance, a part of a HA pair, or is a cluster node* Current time on the system and timestamp when the appliance was last updatedNote: To view the complete configurations that have been executed on the appliance, run the 'show ns runningConfig' command.
