#ns assignment

The following operations can be performed on "ns assignment":


[add](#add-ns-assignment) | [set](#set-ns-assignment) | [unset](#unset-ns-assignment) | [rm](#rm-ns-assignment) | [show](#show-ns-assignment) | [rename](#rename-ns-assignment)

##add ns assignment

Creates an assignment of a value to a variable. The variable (the left hand side) may be a singleton variable or a map with a key expression. The value (the right hand side) is computed from a default syntax expression and may be used to set the variable or may be added to or subtracted from the current value of a ulong variable or appended to a text variable. The key expression, if present, is evaluated before the value expression. The left hand side variable value may also be cleared, in which case there is no value expression.


##Synopsys

add ns assignment &lt;name> -variable &lt;expression> [-set &lt;expression> | -add &lt;expression> | -sub &lt;expression> | -append &lt;expression> | -clear] [-comment &lt;string>]


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name for the assignment. Must begin with a letter, number, or the underscore character (_), and must contain only letters, numbers, and the hyphen (-), period (.) hash (#), space ( ), at (@), equals (=), colon (:), and underscore characters. Can be changed after the assignment is added.
The following requirement applies only to the NetScaler CLI:
If the name includes one or more spaces, enclose the name in double or single quotation marks (for example, "my assignment" or ?my assignment?).

<b>variable</b>
Left hand side of the assigment, of the form $variable-name (for a singleton variabled) or $variable-name[key-expression], where key-expression is a default syntax expression that evaluates to a text string and provides the key to select a map entry

<b>set</b>
Right hand side of the assignment. The default syntax expression is evaluated and assigned to theleft hand variable.

<b>add</b>
Right hand side of the assignment. The default syntax expression is evaluated and added to the left hand variable.

<b>sub</b>
Right hand side of the assignment. The default syntax expression is evaluated and subtracted from the left hand variable.

<b>append</b>
Right hand side of the assignment. The default syntax expression is evaluated and appended to the left hand variable.

<b>clear</b>
Clear the variable value. Deallocates a text value, and for a map, the text key.

<b>comment</b>
Comment. Can be used to preserve information about this rewrite action.
