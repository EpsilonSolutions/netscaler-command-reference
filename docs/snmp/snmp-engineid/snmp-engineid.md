##set snmp engineId

Modifies the SNMPv3 engine identification (ID) on the NetScaler appliance. Caution: Changing the ID of the SNMPv3 engine invalidates the current SNMP users. You have to reconfigure the SNMP users in the SNMP managers.The SNMPv3 engine has an identification (ID) that uniquely identifies it on the appliance and is used in the communication between the SNMPv3 user and the SNMPv3 engine. The engine ID is preconfigured by Citrix and is based on the MAC address of one of its interfaces. Overriding the engine ID is not necessary, but you can change it.
