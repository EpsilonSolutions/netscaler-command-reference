#cache policy

The following operations can be performed on "cache policy":


[add](#add-cache-policy) | [rm](#rm-cache-policy) | [set](#set-cache-policy) | [unset](#unset-cache-policy) | [show](#show-cache-policy) | [stat](#stat-cache-policy) | [rename](#rename-cache-policy)

##add cache policy

Creates an integrated caching policy. The newly created policy is in inactive state. To activate the policy, use the bind cache global command.


##Synopsys

add cache policy &lt;policyName> -rule &lt;expression> -action &lt;action> [-storeInGroup &lt;string>] [-invalGroups &lt;string> ...] [-invalObjects &lt;string> ...] [-undefAction ( NOCACHE | RESET )]


##Arguments

<b>policyName</b>
Name for the policy. Must begin with an ASCII alphabetic or underscore (_) character, and must contain only ASCII alphanumeric, underscore, hash (#), period (.), space, colon (:), at (@), equals (=), and hyphen (-) characters. Can be changed after the policy is created.

<b>rule</b>
Expression against which the traffic is evaluated.
Note:
Maximum length of a string literal in the expression is 255 characters. A longer string can be split into smaller strings of up to 255 characters each, and the smaller strings concatenated with the + operator. For example, you can create a 500-character string as follows: '"&lt;string of 255 characters&gt;" + "&lt;string of 245 characters&gt;"'
The following requirements apply only to the NetScaler CLI:
* If the expression includes one or more spaces, enclose the entire expression in double quotation marks.
* If the expression itself includes double quotation marks, escape the quotations by using the \\ character. 
* Alternatively, you can use single quotation marks to enclose the rule, in which case you do not have to escape the double quotation marks.

<b>action</b>
Action to apply to content that matches the policy. 
* CACHE or MAY_CACHE action - positive cachability policy
* NOCACHE or MAY_NOCACHE action - negative cachability policy
* INVAL action - Dynamic Invalidation Policy
Possible values: CACHE, NOCACHE, MAY_CACHE, MAY_NOCACHE, INVAL

Content group(s) to be invalidated when the INVAL action is applied. Maximum number of content groups that can be specified is 16.

<b>invalObjects</b>
Content groups(s) in which the objects will be invalidated if the action is INVAL.

<b>undefAction</b>
Action to be performed when the result of rule evaluation is undefined.
Possible values: NOCACHE, RESET
