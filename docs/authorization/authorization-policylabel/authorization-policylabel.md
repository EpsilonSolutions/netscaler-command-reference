##add authorization policylabel

Creates a user-defined authorization policy label.


##Synopsys

add authorization policylabel &lt;labelName>


##Arguments

<b>labelName</b>
Name for the new authorization policy label. 
Must begin with a letter, number, or the underscore character (_), and must contain only letters, numbers, and the hyphen (-), period (.) pound (#), space ( ), at (@), equals (=), colon (:), and underscore characters. Cannot be changed after the authorization policy is created.
The following requirement applies only to the NetScaler CLI:
If the name includes one or more spaces, enclose the name in double or single quotation marks (for example, ?my authorization policy label? or ?authorization policy label?).



##Example

add authorization policylabel trans_http_url

##rm authorization policylabel

Removes an authorization policy label.


##Synopsys

rm authorization policylabel &lt;labelName>


##Arguments

<b>labelName</b>
Name of the authorization policy label to remove.



##Example

rm authorization policylabel trans_http_url

##bind authorization policylabel

Binds an authorization policy to a label.


##Synopsys

bind authorization policylabel &lt;labelName> &lt;policyName> &lt;priority> [&lt;gotoPriorityExpression>] [-invoke  (&lt;labelType>  &lt;labelName>) ]


##Arguments

<b>labelName</b>
Name of the policy label to invoke if the current policy evaluates to TRUE, the invoke parameter is set, and Label Type is set to Policy Label.

<b>policyName</b>
Name of the authorization policy to bind to the policy label.

<b>priority</b>
Positive integer specifying the priority of the policy. The lower the number, the higher the priority. Policies within a label are evaluated in the order of their priority numbers.
Minimum value: 1
Maximum value: 2147483647

<b>gotoPriorityExpression</b>
Expression or other value specifying the next policy to be evaluated if the current policy evaluates to TRUE.  Specify one of the following values:
*  NEXT ? Evaluate the policy with the next higher priority number.
*  END ? End policy evaluation.
*  USE_INVOCATION_RESULT ? Applicable if this policy invokes another policy label. If the final goto in the invoked policy label has a value of END, the evaluation stops. If the final goto is anything other than END, the current policy label performs a NEXT.
* A default syntax or classic expression that evaluates to a number.
If you specify an expression, the number to which it evaluates determines the next policy to evaluate, as follows:
*  If the expression evaluates to a higher numbered priority, the policy with that priority is evaluated next.
*  If the expression evaluates to the priority of the current policy, the policy with the next higher numbered priority is evaluated next.
*  If the expression evaluates to a number that is larger than the largest numbered priority, policy evaluation ends.
An UNDEF event is triggered if:
*  The expression is invalid.
*  The expression evaluates to a priority number that is smaller than the current policy?s priority number.
*  The expression evaluates to a priority number that is between the current policy?s priority number (say, 30) and the highest priority number (say, 100), but does not match any configured priority number (for example, the expression evaluates to the number 85). This example assumes that the priority number increments by 10 for every successive policy, and therefore a priority number of 85 does not exist in the policy label.

<b>invoke</b>
If the current policy evaluates to TRUE, terminate evaluation of policies bound to the current policy label, and then either forward the request or response to the specified virtual server or evaluate the specified policy label.

<b>labelType</b>
Type of invocation. Available settings function as follows:
* reqvserver - Send the request to the specified request virtual server.
* resvserver - Send the response to the specified response virtual server.
* policylabel - Invoke the specified policy label.
Possible values: reqvserver, resvserver, policylabel
