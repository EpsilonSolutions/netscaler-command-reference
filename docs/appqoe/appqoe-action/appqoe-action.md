Add a new AppQoE action for triggering


##Synopsys

##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name for the AppQoE action. Must begin with a letter, number, or the underscore symbol (_). Other characters allowed, after the first character, are the hyphen (-), period (.) hash (#), space ( ), at (@), equals (=), and colon (:) characters. This is a mandatory argument

Priority for queuing the request. If server resources are not available for a request that matches the configured rule, this option specifies a priority for queuing the request until the server resources are available again. If priority is not configured then Lowest priority will be used to queue the request.
Possible values: HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, LOWEST

Responder action to be taken when the threshold is reached. Available settings function as follows:
            ACS - Serve content from an alternative content service
