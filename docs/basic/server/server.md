##add server

Creates a server entry on the NetScaler appliance. The NetScaler appliance supports two types of servers: IP address based servers and domain based servers.


##Synopsys

add server &lt;name>@ (&lt;IPAddress>@ | (&lt;domain>@  [-domainResolveRetry &lt;integer>]  [-IPv6Address ( YES | NO )]) | (-translationIp &lt;ip_addr>  -translationMask &lt;netmask>)) [-state ( ENABLED | DISABLED )] [-comment &lt;string>] [-td &lt;positive_integer>]

Name for the server. 
Must begin with an ASCII alphabetic or underscore (_) character, and must contain only ASCII alphanumeric, underscore, hash (#), period (.), space, colon (:), at (@), equals (=), and hyphen (-) characters.

<b>IPAddress</b>
IPv4 or IPv6 address of the server. If you create an IP address based server, you can specify the name of the server, instead of its IP address, when creating a service. Note: If you do not create a server entry, the server IP address that you enter when you create a service becomes the name of the server.
