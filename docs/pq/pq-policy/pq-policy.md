#pq policy

The following operations can be performed on "pq policy":


[add](#add-pq-policy) | [rm](#rm-pq-policy) | [set](#set-pq-policy) | [unset](#unset-pq-policy) | [show](#show-pq-policy) | [stat](#stat-pq-policy)

##add pq policy

Adds a priority queuing policy to the appliance.Note: To use the priority queuing policy on a virtual server, the virtual server must have priority queuing enabled and the priority queuing policy must be bound to the load balancing virtual server. To enable priority queuing on the virtual server and to bind the policy, use the set lb vserver and bind lb vserver commands.


##Synopsys

add pq policy &lt;policyName> -rule &lt;expression> -priority &lt;positive_integer> [-weight &lt;positive_integer>] [-qDepth &lt;positive_integer> | -polqDepth &lt;positive_integer>]


##Arguments

<b>policyName</b>
Name for the priority queuing policy. Must begin with a letter, number, or the underscore symbol (_). Other characters allowed, after the first character, are the hyphen (-), period (.) hash (#), space ( ), at (@), equals (=), and colon (:) characters.

<b>rule</b>
Expression or name of a named expression, against which the request is evaluated. The priority queuing policy is applied if the rule evaluates to true.
Note:
* On the command line interface, if the expression includes blank spaces, the entire expression must be enclosed in double quotation marks.
* If the expression itself includes double quotation marks, you must escape the quotations by using the \\ character. 
* Alternatively, you can use single quotation marks to enclose the rule, in which case you will not have to escape the double quotation marks.
* Maximum length of a string literal in the expression is 255 characters. A longer string can be split into smaller strings of up to 255 characters each, and the smaller strings concatenated with the + operator. For example, you can create a 500-character string as follows: '"&lt;string of 255 characters&gt;" + "&lt;string of 245 characters&gt;"'

<b>priority</b>
Priority for queuing the request. If server resources are not available for a request that matches the configured rule, this option specifies a priority for queuing the request until the server resources are available again. Enter the value of positive_integer as 1, 2 or 3. The highest priority level is 1 and the lowest priority value is 3.
Minimum value: 1
Maximum value: 3

<b>weight</b>
Weight of the priority. Each priority is assigned a weight according to which it is served when server resources are available. The weight for a higher priority request must be set higher than that of a lower priority request.
To prevent delays for low-priority requests across multiple priority levels, you can configure weighted queuing for serving requests. The default weights for the priorities
are:
* Gold - Priority 1 - Weight 3
* Silver - Priority 2 - Weight 2
* Bronze - Priority 3 - Weight 1
Specify the weights as 0 through 101. A weight of 0 indicates that the particular priority level should be served only when there are no requests in any of the priority queues.
A weight of 101 specifies a weight of infinity. This means that this priority level is served irrespective of the number of clients waiting in other priority queues.
Minimum value: 0
Maximum value: 101

<b>qDepth</b>
Queue depth threshold value. When the queue size (number of requests in the queue) on the virtual server to which this policy is bound, increases to the specified qDepth value, subsequent requests are dropped to the lowest priority level.
Default value: 0
Minimum value: 0
Maximum value: 4294967294

<b>polqDepth</b>
Policy queue depth threshold value. When the policy queue size (number of requests in all the queues belonging to this policy) increases to the specified polqDepth value, subsequent requests are dropped to the lowest priority level.
Default value: 0
Minimum value: 0
Maximum value: 4294967294
