#cmp policy

The following operations can be performed on "cmp policy":


[add](#add-cmp-policy) | [rm](#rm-cmp-policy) | [set](#set-cmp-policy) | [show](#show-cmp-policy) | [stat](#stat-cmp-policy) | [rename](#rename-cmp-policy)

##add cmp policy

Creates a classic or default syntax HTTP compression policy. When the policy matches an HTTP request or response, the action specified in the policy is performed on the transaction. The policy can be bound globally or to an entity. For the policy to have an effect, compression must be enabled on the service.


##Synopsys

add cmp policy &lt;name> -rule &lt;expression> -resAction &lt;string>


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name of the HTTP compression policy. Must begin with an ASCII alphabetic or underscore (_) character, and must contain only ASCII alphanumeric, underscore, hash (#), period (.), space, colon (:), at (@), equals (=), and hyphen (-) characters.
Can be changed after the policy is created. 
The following requirement applies only to the NetScaler CLI:
If the name includes one or more spaces, enclose the name in double or single quotation marks (for example, "my cmp policy" or 'my cmp policy').

<b>rule</b>
Expression that determines which HTTP requests or responses match the compression policy. Can be a classic expression or a default-syntax expression.  
Note:
Maximum length of a string literal in the expression is 255 characters. A longer string can be split into smaller strings of up to 255 characters each, and the smaller strings concatenated with the + operator. For example, you can create a 500-character string as follows: '"&lt;string of 255 characters&gt;" + "&lt;string of 245 characters&gt;"'
The following requirements apply only to the NetScaler CLI:
* If the expression includes one or more spaces, enclose the entire expression in double quotation marks.
* If the expression itself includes double quotation marks, escape the quotations by using the \\ character. 
* Alternatively, you can use single quotation marks to enclose the rule, in which case you do not have to escape the double quotation marks.

<b>resAction</b>
The built-in or user-defined compression action to apply to the response when the policy matches a request or response.



##Example

Example 1:add cmp policy pdf_cmp -rule "RES.HTTP.HEADER Content-Type CONTAINS application/pdf" -resAction COMPRESSAfter creating the above compression policy, you must activate it by binding it globally:bind cmp global pdf_cmpThe NetScaler system will use the configured pdf_cmp compression policy to perform compression of pdf files.Example 2:The following command disables compression for all the access from the specific subnet.add cmp policy local_sub_nocmp -rule "SOURCEIP == 10.1.1.0 -netmask 255.255.255.0" -resAction NOCOMPRESSbind cmp global local_sub_nocmp

##rm cmp policy

Removes a user-defined HTTP compression policy.


##Synopsys

rm cmp policy &lt;name>


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name of the HTTP compression policy to be removed.



##Example

rm cmp policy cmp_policy_nameThe "show cmp policy" command shows all currently defined HTTP compression policies.

##set cmp policy

Modifies the specified parameters of an HTTP compression policy. Note: Use the show cmp policy command to view all configured HTTP compression policies.


##Synopsys

set cmp policy &lt;name> [-rule &lt;expression>] [-resAction &lt;string>]


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name of the HTTP compression policy to be modified.

<b>rule</b>
New rule to be associated with the HTTP compression policy. You can modify the existing rule or create a new rule.

<b>resAction</b>
The built-in or user-defined compression action to be associated with the policy.



##Example

Example 1:add cmp policy pdf_cmp -rule "RES.HTTP.HEADER Content-Type CONTAINS application/pdf" -resAction COMPRESSAfter creating the above compression policy, you must activate it by binding it globally:bind cmp global pdf_cmpThe NetScaler system will use the configured pdf_cmp compression policy to perform compression for pdf files.To disable pdf compression for Internet Explorer, you can change the above compression policy by issuing the following command:set cmp policy pdf_cmp -rule "RES.HTTP.HEADER Content-Type CONTAINS application/pdf && RES.HTTP.HEADER User-Agent NOTCONTAINS MSIE"To view the changed cmp policy, enter the following command:&gt;show cmp policy pdf_cmp        Name: pdf_cmp   Rule: (RES.HTTP.HEADER Content-Type CONTAINS application/pdf && REQ.HTTP.HEADER User-Agent NOTCONTAINS MSIE)        Response action: COMPRESS       Hits: 2        Bytes In:...609284      Bytes Out:... 443998        Bandwidth saving...27.13%       Ratio 1.37:1 Done
