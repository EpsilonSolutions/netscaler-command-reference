The following operations can be performed on "policy patset":


[add](#add-policy-patset) | [rm](#rm-policy-patset) | [bind](#bind-policy-patset) | [unbind](#unbind-policy-patset) | [show](#show-policy-patset)

##add policy patset

Adds a pattern set. A pattern set contains a name and one or more string patterns. Pattern sets can be used in default syntax expressions to match a set of strings. For example, HTTP.REQ.URL.EQUALS_ANY("test_urls"), where test_urls is a pattern set containing URL strings. Pattern sets can also be used in the search parameter of a rewrite action. Each string pattern is assigned an index that enables you to select the associated string from the set.


##Synopsys

add policy patset &lt;name> [-indexType ( Auto-generated | User-defined )] [-comment &lt;string>]


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Unique name of the pattern set. Not case sensitive. Must begin with an ASCII letter or underscore (_) character and must contain only alphanumeric and underscore characters. Must not be the name of an existing named expression, pattern set, dataset, string map, or HTTP callout.

<b>indexType</b>
Index type.

<b>comment</b>
Any comments to preserve information about this patset.



##Example

add policy patset pat1

##rm policy patset

Removes a pattern set. If the pattern set is used by an expression in another object, such as a policy, you must remove the object before removing the pattern set.


##Synopsys

rm policy patset &lt;name>


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name of the pattern set to remove.



##Example

rm policy patset pat1

##bind policy patset

Binds a string to a pattern set.


##Synopsys

bind policy patset &lt;name> &lt;string> [-index &lt;positive_integer>] [-charset ( ASCII | UTF_8 )]


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name of the pattern set to which to bind the string.

<b>string</b>
String of characters that constitutes a pattern. For more information about the characters that can be used, refer to the character set parameter.
Note: Minimum length for pattern sets used in rewrite actions of type REPLACE_ALL, DELETE_ALL, INSERT_AFTER_ALL, and INSERT_BEFORE_ALL, is three characters.



##Example

bind policy patset pat1 bar -index 2

##unbind policy patset

Unbinds a string from a pattern set.


##Synopsys

unbind policy patset &lt;name> &lt;string> ...


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name of the pattern set from which to unbind a string.

<b>string</b>
String of characters to unbind from the pattern set.



##Example

unbind policy patset pat1 bar xyz

##show policy patset

Displays the list of pattern sets configured on the appliance.


##Synopsys

show policy patset [&lt;name>]


##Arguments

<b>name</b>
Name of the pattern set for which to display the detailed information. If a name is not provided, a list of all pattern sets configured on the appliance is shown.

##Outputs

<b>stateflag</b>

<b>string</b>
String of characters that constitutes a pattern. For more information about the characters that can be used, refer to the character set parameter.
Note: Minimum length for pattern sets used in rewrite actions of type REPLACE_ALL, DELETE_ALL, INSERT_AFTER_ALL, and INSERT_BEFORE_ALL, is three characters.

<b>index</b>
The index of the string associated with the patset.

<b>charset</b>
Character set associated with the characters in the string.
Note: UTF-8 characters can be entered directly (if the UI supports it) or can be encoded as a sequence of hexadecimal bytes '\\xNN'. For example, the UTF-8 character '?' can be encoded as '\\xC3\\xBC'.

<b>description</b>
Description of the patset

<b>isDefault</b>

<b>indexType</b>
Index type.

<b>builtin</b>
Indicates that a variable is a built-in (SYSTEM INTERNAL) type.

<b>MaxIndex</b>
Maximum number of patterns bounded to pattern set. The maxindex value will not be decreased when we unbind a pattern from the patset. This field is used in auto-generated indexing type.
